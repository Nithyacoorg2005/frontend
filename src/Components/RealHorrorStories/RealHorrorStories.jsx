      description:
        "Made famous by Ed and Lorraine Warren, who first discovered the possessed doll, the allegedly true story of Annabelle has inspired a book, and two of the films from The Conjuring film franchise. On the silver screen Annabelle is an prized antique doll that plagues the living with death and despair. Yet, the real Annabelle looks far less menacing. She is in fact a Raggedy Ann doll, one of many that has been mass-produced. In this particular doll, however, it has been said, that a dark demon lies - an inhuman demonic entity which possesses the desire to inflict pain. But is the story of Annabelle real? And can the Warrens be trusted?",

      description:
        "Some have sensationally dubbed it “the most mysterious case of the 21st century”. Yet, how much do we actually know about Elisa Lam's bizarre, possibly paranormal-related, death? In this paranormal documentary, the Paranormal Scholar presents the humanised story of an intelligent and passionate young woman, who perished under mysterious circumstances in early 2013 at the Cecil Hotel of Los Angeles. Although Elisa's death was described as accidental by the police, many have been left unsatisfied in the months and years which followed. Various alternative theories have been put forward. We aim to outline - and where possible - disprove these theories, always providing evidence as we do. What happened in that hotel? Is this a case of true crime, true horror, or a tragic accident?",
